This package solves the problem of turning off inlining
when compiling a Common Lisp system.   To use it, wrap
the macro DISABLE-INLINE:WITH-NO-INLINE around the
compilation:

(disable-inline:with-no-inline (ql:quickload <system>))

Inside the dynamic environment created by this macro,
any DEFPACKAGE form is modified (via a macroexpand hook)
to shadow INLINE with a symbol that is a meaningless
but valid declaration.

The main purpose of this is to compile public Common Lisp
systems so the coverage of their test suites can be measured
using sbcl's sb-cover package.   This will still not handle
coverage of defmacros; for that systems should move their
macros to separate files from the ones they are used in.
Even that will not handle coverage of the code expanded
from uses of these macros; for that, Waters' COVER package
is recommended.
